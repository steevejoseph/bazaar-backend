# First Things First

I like the progression of the project the last week. I wanted to make sure we got add, edit, search, and delete for sure, specifically since it's what we committed to in the Powerpoint. Notice I'm trying to avoid the term [MVP.](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp)

 As I'm sure you've noticed, something simple in theory isn't necessarily straightforward in practice and I wanted to thank you guys for hanging in there as we strived for that baseline.

That being said, it should be viewed as a checkpoint, not necessarily an end-goal. So for anyone who was wondering if there was any more work to be done, there's always more to do and always improvements to make.



# Final  ~~Countdown~~ ~~Fortnight~~ ~~Sprint~~ Two Weeks

I wanted to leave some time before (what would have been Nov 19-21) for some feature exploration, without the daunting effects of [feature creep](http://ninjawords.com/feature%20creep). 

Specifically, if one of us were so inclined or inspired to implement something, I thought it'd be nice to have a couple of days to try to bang out that feature now that they are more familiar with the tech on the frontend.

For example, the **Interested** stripe on the bottom of an individual service on the web wasn't planned to the T, but it was a nice addition. 


# Pics Or It Didn't Happen
Apologies for an abrupt departure on Tuesday. I've been wrassling with Imgur's API for the past couple weeks so that we can have free image hosting and not have to host files on our own server.

Pretty sure I had a breakthrough in class for the web client and **as of ~4:45 am today, adding images to a service should as simple as sending a request to a Bazaar API endpoint** and sending an image file as form data. 

Of course, documentation to come, and you can see some working examples [here](https://github.com/steevejoseph/bazaar-mobile/blob/master/README.md), and a sample service model [here](https://bazaar-backend.herokuapp.com/api/services/5bf563b0a9068e001623cef8).
Adding photos to a user account is also supported.






# Next Steps

Leinecker's graced us with no class on the 27th, 29th, and also no exam 3. That gives us time to implement some functionality that is both nontrivial and worthwhile.

Some potential features, listed in order of (perceived) feasibility:
* Reporting services/users (flagging may be the better word)
* Locking signup/login to only UCF affiliated emails
* User pages/profiles
* Favoriting/unfavoriting services
* Ratings/comments for services
* Tracking "interested" services
* User messaging
* Notifications on "events"
    * Someone's interested in someone else's service
    * New message received

Again, leaving these somewhat vague to not obscure the creative vision of the implementor.  Also, you'll probably notice I've kind of backed off a litle on some of the features we talked in the beginning of this project. 

At the time, I think we were under the impression that we could just slap some React on there and be good. Unfortunately, [React ain't no Mimsy](https://knowyourmeme.com/videos/132334-south-park) and it + conflicting schedules ended up being more of an impediment than anticipated. 

It's a good thing that [the impediment to action advances action](https://medium.com/personal-growth/the-impediment-to-action-advances-action-304ed19ef208).


# Roadmap

## Sunday, 11/25 - Monday, 11/26
* These days will primarily be focused on styling, specifically:
    * Fleshing out more of the look and feel on web client
    * Actually adding some color to mobile client
  
* Also a goal for these days is tying up loose ends, making sure we've got the hiccups out of the way with what we have so far.


## Tuesday, 11/27 - Thursday, 11/29
  * Class cancelled
  * Most likely will be meeting 
    * Location TBD, most likely the StarterSpace again
  

## Sunday, 12/2
  * Presentation dry runs and testing   
    * Aiming for ~8-10 minutes for both web and mobile demos.
  
  * This will probably be the last time we meet before the presentation, bring your best.

## Monday, 12/3 - Thursday, 12/6
  * Testing, mostly end-to-end/UI
