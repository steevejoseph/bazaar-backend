Hey y'all, I'm wanting us to meet sometime tonight to get another set of rehearsals in, hopefully in the actual room for Processes. Time and place still TBD for now, though it will most likely be ~10, 10:30 in HEC.

Reminiscient to how we rehearsed Sunday, here's a brief layout of how the presentation is going to go. Pretty straightforward, as the person is talking about the feature, I'll be demoing it.

1. Introductions
2. Quick summary of problem statement: Rolando
3. Bazaar: Nyasha
4. Bazaar, cont: Abe
5. Create: Nyasha
6. Options: Abe
7. User profile: Anthony
8. Edit: Wyatt
9. Delete: Brian
10. Chat: Stephen
11. Favorites: Affner
12. Reviews: Rolando

Basically, the set of things to be shown on the web client are:
  * creating/editing/deleting a service
  * uploading a photo 
  * user profile
  * options

The set of things to be shown on the mobile client are:
  * chat
  * favorites (hopefully)
  * reviews (hopefully)

I believe we were getting 4-5 mins on average last meet, so if we need to fill time, we can go through the reciprocals of above (so create/etc on mobile, and chat initiated on web, etc), and then maybe into signup and talk more about authentication.

We should be able to get through all of those without a hitch, though we might be switching to web for favorites and reviews. Expect an update later tonight.

Feel free to PM with questions/comments/concerns/suggestions.

Kind regards, <br>
Steeve
