# Intro
Hey y'all, some quick updates:
* We're be using React as our frontend framework this time around.
* We'll be using React Native as our mobile platform.

* Also, our authentication scheme is different from last project.
  * For this one, we'll be going for token-based authentication.

# Features
* I've included the features we talked about last lab [here](feature_set_initial.md)
  * Essentially, the work flow for each will be something like:
    * in progress on web
    * in review on web
    * working on web
    * in progress on mobile
    * review on mobile
    * working on mobile
    * done.

  * I've left them vague intentionally because I trust the implementation that the individual working on them will come up with.

# Next Steps

**ASAP**

The project structure's changed a bit from Coma. Familiarize yourself with it and how it works.<br><br>


**Thursday, October, 10th**

Be able to:
  * create a basic web app with React
  * create a basic mobile app with React Native
  * make get/post requests from web/mobile
  * read from and write to localStorage from web/mobile

For mobile, I'm going to say write code for the mobile OS you have right now.
